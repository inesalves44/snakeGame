# **My First Website: Snake Game Recreation**

Dive into my debut website created with the basic building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## **The Genesis**

My vision encompassed two iconic games: Snake and Frogger. Regrettably, time only permitted the revival of Snake.

## **Website Chronicles**

My website has several distinctive sections:

1. **Home Sweet Home - HTMLMainPage**
   The landing pad of my website, where the adventure commences.

2. **Pages from the Past - Game History**
   Delve into the gaming history with pages dedicated to Frogger and Snake. A homage to the classics.

3. **About Me - Behind the Curtain**
   About the creator as you step into the 'About Me' page, providing a glimpse into the individual behind this website (maybe).

4. **Game Haven - A Duel of Classics**
   As of now, only the Snake game stands, ready to be conquered.

## **Unleash the Snake**

To experience the Snake game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone and Conquer**
   Clone the repository to your domain and traverse the website till the gateway to the Snake game.

2. **Personalize Your Play**
   Before immersing yourself in nostalgia, embrace customization. Handpick the snake's hues and the backdrop's shades, curating a unique ambiance.

3. **Embrace the Retro**
   With colors set and ambiance perfected, it's time to relive the past. Navigate the snake through pixelated terrain, aiming for a triumphant feast.
